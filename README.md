# Discord Bots

This repository contains two simple Discord bots developed using JavaScript which can be integrated into any Disord server:

1. **calendarBot.js**: A bot designed to manage and display events or calendar entries within a Discord server.
2. **chatBot.js**: A conversational bot that interacts with users, providing responses based on predefined commands or messages.
